What to Eat?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The "What to Eat?" app is a fun and interactive tool designed to solve the timeless dilemma of deciding where to eat. By leveraging Yelp's vast database of restaurants, this app provides users with a random restaurant recommendation tailored to their preferences.

How it works:

1. Enter your postal code or allow location access to find restaurants near you.
2. Select category based on what you are craving. 
3. Let the app randomly pick one.

Pre-requisites:
1. Yelp API key (signup for Yelp developer free trial, create app and they provide API key)
2. Node.js
3. React

Note: I am not a software engineer, but a product manager by trade. As like many PM's, I have feature and product ideas, but not necessarily the technical abilities to code those into reality. However, AI has changed this, and with the powerful tools of AI, I can take a product or feature vision and slowly see it become reality with limited technical knowledge. This app is intending not to showcase how good (or bad) I am at React or API development, but to showcase that with a simple idea, today's technology makes it possible for the non-technical to see it become a reality.
